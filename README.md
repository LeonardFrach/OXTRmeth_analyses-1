----DMPs_and_DMRs (results from CpG-wise analyses)
----multimedBootResults_cat (bootstrapping results of multivariate mediation with categorical trauma IV)
----multimedBootResults_cont (bootstrapping results of multivariate mediation with continuous trauma IV)
----multivarMediation_loadings (CpG loadings for both multivaritate mediation models)
----OXTR_table S1_CpG numbering (supplementary table)

----shinyPrepareOXTRstructure (results table for shinyapp)

Most analyses can be performed by opening the R-Project file "OXTRmeth_analyses" and then opening OXTRstructure.R.
Before running this script, make sure the package renv is installed using install.packages("renv"). Then, use
renv::restore() to restore our package versions. Packages should be installed automatically when you run the code.
Similarly, paths will be set in a cross-platform compatible manner, relative to the R-project file, 
using the package "here". Results were last checked with the following session info:

R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01)
Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)
Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 22000)

The script "singleCpgs_and_DMRs.R" can be used to check the CpG-wise analyses.

The script "MediationAnalysis.m" contains the mediation analyses, performed in matlab (v2020a).
